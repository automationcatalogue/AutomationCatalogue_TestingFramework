==> Applications are '3' types
	1. Desktop applications
	2. Web applications --> website
	3. Mobile applications

Selenium
--------
==> It is a web based automation testing tool

SDLC --> Software Development Life Cycle
STLC --> Software Testing Life Cycle

Testing:
-------
==> Testing is one of the process in SDLC, which determines the application is meeting the given requirements (or) not.

1. Requirment Gathering
2. Feasibility Analysis
3. Design
