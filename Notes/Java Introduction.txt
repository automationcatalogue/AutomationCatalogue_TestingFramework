JAVA
-----
==> 1995 Java was Invented in Sun Microsystems

==> It is a Proramming language
==> Operating System


Java is a Programming language, because we write programs by using Java Language
==> By using Java Programming
1. Applications
2. Services


==> Java is Platform Independent Programming language

Examples of Programming language:
---------------------------------
C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Grovvy Script etc.,

==> Both Compilers and Interpreters are called language translation softwares
==> By using Compilers and Interpreters, we can convert from one format to another format

	Compilers										Interpreters
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Compilers converts whole program at a time		1. Interpreter converts the program line by line
2. Compiler produces a file							2. Interpreters will not produces any file
3. Compiler is fast									3. Interpreter is slow





				C											Java
				|											 |
		--------------------------------------------------------------
		|															|
		demo.c (unicode)											demo.java (unicode)
		|															|
		C Compiler													Java Compiler
		|															|
		demo.exe (bit code)											demo.class (byte code)
		|																|
		O/P														--------------------------
																|			|			|
															Windows JVM		Linux JVM	Mac JVM
																| (JIT)		|			|
															Windows			Linux		Mac
																|			|			|
																O/P			O/P			O/P
		
		
		
		
		
==> JVM: (Java Virtual Machine)
1. It is called as an Interpreter and it converts byte code into the bit code
	
	
==> 'C' is a Platform dependent programming language, 
whereas Java is Platform Independent programming language


==> JVM is a platform dependent where as Java is platform Independent

JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
-------------------------------
==> JRE is called as a Java Platform and it contains Java API (Application Programming Interface) and JVM

Java API:
--------
==> It is called as a Java Library and It is included in Java Prgram at run time

JDK (Java Development Kit):
---------------------------
==> It is a combination of JRE, Java Program and Operting System

JIT Compiler (Just In-time Compiler):
-------------------------------------
==> JIT Compiler is introduced in Java to increase the performance of JVM
==> JIT Compiler produces a file and keeps in cache memory as soon as the execution is completed by the JVM and then this generated file will be deleted automatically

==> JIT Compiler is a part of JVM, JVM is a part of JRE, JRE is a part of JDK
